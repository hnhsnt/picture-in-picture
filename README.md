# Picture in Picture
This repository was created to make a page that allows you to use picture in picture.

## Github Page
Link to the quote generator page: [https://hnhsnt.github.io/picture-in-picture/](https://hnhsnt.github.io/picture-in-picture/)

## Usage
This page initially prompts you which content to share. You would need to have another window open, with the video that you want to share in full screen mode. As of February 24, 2024, to share the content from a Google Chrome browser, you have to select the video in the **Chrome Tab** tab, and then click on share. Finally, click on the START button to have the picture in picture video.

As for other browsers, I haven't tried them yet.
